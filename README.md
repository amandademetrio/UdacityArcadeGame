# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## What is this

This is a basic javscript game. 

## How to Play

Open the page on your browser and move the little girl around with you keyboard keys for up, down, left and right. Your character starts on the grass (green part of the screen).

Your goal is to move the little girl all the way up to the water without colliding with the bugs moving above you. The bugs move in random speeds and the speed change for each loop they do around the board.

Everytime, the little girl collides with an enemy, the game starts over. If you safely reach the water, you'll get a pop up message congratulating you and asking if you would like to play again.

## Context

The initial code for this game and the image resources were provided by Udacity for their front end nanodegree students. Starting with their code, I've developed the game to its current position.
