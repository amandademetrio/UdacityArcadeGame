# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## What is this

This is a basic javscript game. 

## How to Play

* Open the *index.html* file on your browser and you will see a gameboard with three layers: one with grass, one with stones and one with water. 

* At the bottom of the board, you will see a little girl with a cat hat --that will be your player during this game.

* Your goal is to move the little girl all the way up to the water without colliding with the bugs moving above you. You can move her around with you keyboard keys for up, down, left and right.

* The bugs on the stone area move in random speeds and the speed change for each loop they do around the board. You should move quickly to avoid collision with them. Everytime the little girl collides with an enemy, the game starts over. 

* You win the game if you safely reach the water (without colliding with bugs). In that scenario, you'll get a pop up message congratulating you and asking if you would like to play again.

## Context

The initial code for this game and the image resources were provided by Udacity for their front end nanodegree students. Starting with their code, I've developed the game to its current position.
